/**
 * Test the javax.rules.StatelessRuleSession class.
 * <p>
 * The definition of the rule execution set can be found in the
 * "tck_res_1.xml" file.<br>
 * This RuleExecutionSet will be invoked by the TCK in a stateless
 * manner.<br>
 * The rule execution set must have support for the following business
 * object model:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Customer Class.<br>
 * The Customer business object is a simple business object that
 * contains a name and credit limit property. The definition of this
 * class can be found in {@link org.jcp.jsr94.tck.model.Customer}
 * <li>Invoice Class.<br>
 * The Invoice business object is a simple business object that
 * contains a description, amount, and status property. The definition
 * of this class can be found in {@link org.jcp.jsr94.tck.model.Invoice}
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The rule execution set has the following definition:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Support Customer and Invoice business objects.
 * <li>Defines 1 logical rule.<br>
 * Rule1:<br>
 * If the credit limit of the customer is greater than the amount of
 * the  invoice and the status of the invoice is unpaid then
 * decrement the credit limit with the amount of the invoice and
 * set the status of the invoice to "paid".
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b><br>
 * Additional physical rules may be defined to accomplish the
 * requirements mentioned above.<p>
 * The rule execution set has the following semantics:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Input: <br>
 * A Customer with a credit limit of 5000.<br>
 * An Invoice with an amount of 2000.<br>
 * </ul>
 * The rule execution should produce the following output:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The credit limit of the customer is 3000
 * <li>The status of the invoice is paid.
 * </ul>
 * <b>Performs the following tests:</b><br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Basic API tests. {@link #testStatelessRuleSession}
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create stateless rule session
 * <li>Execute Rules and verify results
 * <li>Execute Rules with object filtering
 * </ul>
