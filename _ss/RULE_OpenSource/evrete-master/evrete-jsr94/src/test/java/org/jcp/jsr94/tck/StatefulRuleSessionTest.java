/**
 * Test the javax.rules.StatefulRuleSession class.
 * <p>
 * The definition of this rule execution set can be found in the
 * "tck_res_2.xml" file.<br>
 * This RuleExecutionSet will be invoked by the TCK in a stateful manner.<br>
 * This rule execution set will first be invoked with one set of parameters,
 * process this input and keep the state of the execution.
 * A subsequent invocation will add additional information to the
 * rule execution set and the processing will involve both the newly
 * provided information and the processed information of the
 * previous execution.
 * <p>
 * The rule execution set must have support for the following business
 * object model:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Customer Class.<br>
 * The Customer business object is a simple business object that
 * contains  a name and credit limit property. The definition of this
 * class  can be found in {@link org.jcp.jsr94.tck.model.Customer}
 * <li>Invoice Class.<br>
 * The Invoice business object is a simple business object that
 * contains a  description, amount, and status property.
 * The definition of this class can be found
 * in {@link org.jcp.jsr94.tck.model.Invoice}
 * </ul>
 * The rule execution set has the following definition:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Support Invoice and Customer business object as input.
 * <li>Defines 1 logical rule.<br>
 * Rule1:<br>
 * If the credit limit of the customer is greater than the amount of
 * the invoice and the status of the invoice is unpaid then
 * decrement the credit limit with the amount of the invoice and
 * set the status of the invoice to "paid".
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b><br>
 * Additional physical rules may be defined to accomplish the
 * requirements mentioned above.
 * <p>
 * The rule execution set has the following semantics:<br>
 * The first input to the rule execution set is:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A Customer with a credit limit of 5000.
 * <li>An Invoice with an amount of 2000.
 * </ul>
 * The rule execution should produce the following output:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The credit limit of the customer is 3000
 * <li>The status of the invoice is paid.
 * </ul>
 * The second input to the rule execution set is:
 * <ul>
 * <li>An Invoice with an amount of 1500.
 * </ul>
 * The rule execution should produce the following output:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The credit limit of the customer is 1500
 * <li>The status of the invoices is paid.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Performs the following tests:</b><br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Basic API tests. {@link #testStatefulRuleSession}
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create Stateful rule session
 * <li>Add and Remove and Get objects
 * <li>Execute rules
 * <li>Get processed objects
 * <li>Object filtering
